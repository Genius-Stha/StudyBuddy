We are more than happy to present our latest product: \"COMPUTER NETWORKING BEGINNERS GUIDE\" - a comprehensive guide for any newcomer interested in understanding the operation of computer networks and telecommunications technology in general. A computer network is a type of telecommunications network characterized by a set of hardware devices with appropriate switching software, nodes connected to each other by special communication channels (links), such as to provide a communication service that allows the exchange and sharing of data and communication between multiple users or devices. The data is transferred as a PDU (Packet Data Unit), consisting of a header (which contains the data for sending the message) and a body (which contains the body of the message), all governed by strict protocols. To create a computer network it is necessary to know all the basic concepts so that the network is efficient and above all safe from possible external attacks. Whether you are responsible for a small network or a large network, this book is full of information needed to create a network and keep it running. Becoming a network owner has never been easier. This is the basic guide to creating, managing and protecting a successful network. It is the network guide for every beginner. When you finish reading this book you will learn ALL the basic concepts for an efficient and secure network. ................ and much more, Topics: Wireless communication technologies Mobile communication systems The challenges of wireless technology Network protocols Wireless technology security Wireless network security features Security issues in wireless networks Wireless computer network architecture Security architecture Wireless cellular networks Communication and network systems Cisco, CCNA Systems.

This book is all you need! It will help you navigate your way to becoming proficient with network fundamentals and technology. When the first computers were built during the Second World War, they were expensive and isolated. However, after about twenty years, as their prices gradually decreased, the first experiments began to connect computers together. At the time, sharing them over a long distance was an interesting idea. Computers and the Internet have changed this world and our lifestyle forever. We just need to touch a small button and within a fraction of a second, we can make a call, send a file or video message. The major factor that lies behind this advanced technology is none other than computer network. That's why it's important to know how it works! Networking for Beginners covers the following topics: Networking Basics - This chapter considers the needs of a real beginner in computer networking and covers the following crucial topics: definition of computer networking, types of computer networks, network topologies, and network architecture. Network Hardware - A comprehensive discussion on different network components that include routers, hubs, switches, etc. Network Cabling - This chapter discusses the different cabling standards include coaxial, fiber optic cable and twisted-pair copper cable.

Using the Internet as the primary example, this best-selling classic textbook explains various protocols and networking technologies. The systems-oriented approach encourages students to think about how individual network components fit into a larger, complex system of interactions. This sixth edition contains completely updated content with expanded coverage of the topics of utmost importance to networking professionals and students, as provided by numerous contributors via a unique open source model developed jointly by the authors and publisher. Hallmark features of the book are retained, including chapter problem statements, which introduce issues to be examined; shaded sidebars that elaborate on a topic or introduce a related advanced topic; What's Next? discussions that deal with emerging issues in research, the commercial world, or society; and exercises. This book is intended primarily for graduate or upper-division undergraduate classes in computer networking. It will also be useful for industry professionals retraining for network-related assignments, as well as for network practitioners seeking to understand the workings of network protocols and the big picture of networking. - Features completely updated content with expanded coverage of the topics of utmost importance to students and networking professionals - Includes coverage of WiFi and cellular communication, security and cryptography, multimedia, and other applications - Includes expanded guidelines for instructors who prefer to teach networking using a \"top-down\" approach - Features chapter problem statements which introduce issues to be examined and shaded sidebars that elaborate on topics and introduce related ones\n",
